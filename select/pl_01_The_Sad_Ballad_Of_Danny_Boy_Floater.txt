That's right my name is Danny
Boy and I like to drink at
night.
I go down to the pub, wherein I
buy myself a pint or three.
I like to go out drinking,
'cause beer it is my life,
until I come home and lay eyes
upon my darling wife.
And they say
Oh Danny, won't you go home
earlier tonight?
Your daugher doesn't know you
and your giving us a fright when
you say...
Say, something's wrong with
anyone who's not like me.
With you the violence just comes
so easily.
You never learn I have to teach
you constantly.
Just hush now, hush now, hush
now.
That's right my name is Danny
Boy and I'll buy another round.
Then off to the market when this
place closes down.
'Cause I say drinking's always
done when the sun's up in the
sky.
The sun is always up somwhere,
and it's your turn to buy and
they say,
Oh, Danny, won't you go home
earlier tonight?
Your son he doesn't know you and
your giving us a fright when you
say
Say, somthing's wrong with
anyone who's not like me.
With you the violence just comes
so easily.
You never learn I have to teach
you constantly.
Hush now.
Hush now.
Sleep.
Sleep floating child.
..This is affectionate.
